# Reading data into R

getwd()
# should be "C:/Users/krl0022/Documents" or similar

# we can then change the working directory to a specific folder for our project
setwd("C:/Currant/LMER_reading_group/")
# let's see what is in the data folder

# Note that thus datafile is the "altered" datafile from Long's 2012 book.
# Originally, there were two datafiles, one used in chapters 3-5 and one in 6-11
# (see Long's Errata). To make things simpler, we will use only the altered data
# so that our numbers align with later chapters.

# We can also use "file.choose()" to get a popup window

# Descriptive Statistics
mean(MPLS$read.8, na.rm=TRUE)
mymeans <- mean(MPLS[ ,8:11], na.rm = TRUE)
mymeans
# Does Long's code work anymore?
# Try the colMeans() function instead
colMeans(MPLS[ ,c(8,11)], na.rm=TRUE)
mean(MPLS[ ,8], na.rm = TRUE)
# We can also do this more elegantly using other functions below

# Long's SD code did not work for me either
# mysds <- sd(MPLS[ ,2:5], na.rm = TRUE)
# mysds

# We can, however get correlation matrices...
table1<-cor(MPLS[ ,c(8,9,10,11)], use = "complete.obs")
table1
# .. and covariance matrices
cov(MPLS[ ,8:11], use = "complete.obs")
# again, we are subsetting MPLS to take ALL rows, but only columns 2 through 5

mymiss <- colSums(is.na(MPLS[ ,8:11]))
mean(is.na(MPLS$read.8))
# Note that Long has colMeans here, but I think that colSums is more helpful
# mymiss <- colMeans(is.na(MPLS[ ,2:5]))
mymiss

# What if I want means and standard deviations for my different groups?
# Sadly, Long's code was not working for me here either...
# ... I suspect because it was written using plyr when dplyr is more current
# Either way below is what Long says you can do:
# library("plyr"); library("dplyr")
# myrisk <- ddply(.data = MPLS[ ,2:5], .variables = .(MPLS$risk),
#                .fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
# Although you can make it work in plyr
ddply(MPLS,~gen,summarise,
      sd5=sd(read.5, na.rm=TRUE),
      mean6=mean(read.6, na.rm=TRUE),
      mean7=mean(read.7, na.rm=TRUE),
      mean8=mean(read.8, na.rm=TRUE))
?ddply()

# but in dplyr it looks like:
by_risk<-summarize(group_by(MPLS,risk), 
          mean5 = mean(read.5, na.rm=TRUE),
          mean6 = mean(read.6, na.rm=TRUE),
          mean7 = mean(read.7, na.rm=TRUE),
          mean8 = mean(read.8, na.rm=TRUE))

by_risk<-as.data.frame(by_risk)
by_risk
# at first this might seem like more work in dplyr, but trust me
# once we learn about 'piping' dplyr is oodles more efficient and effective


##---------------------------------------------------
# Reshaping Data

# The MPLS data is currently in wide format, suppose we want it in long format?
MPLS.L <- reshape(data = MPLS, varying = 8:11, v.names = "read", timevar = "grade",
                  times = 5:8, idvar = "subid", direction = "long")
head(MPLS.L, n = 10)
head(MPLS)

# As you can see the MPLS.L is grouped by grade
# What if we want all of the data from one subject together in order?
# (i.e., group by subject then by grade)
MPLS.LS <- MPLS.L[order(MPLS.L$subid, MPLS.L$grade), ]
head(MPLS.LS, n = 10)
# Note that the row names (far left column) are a wierd concatenation
# We can remove these row nows with:
rownames(MPLS.LS) <- NULL

tail(MPLS.LS)
MPLS.LS <- subset(MPLS.LS, select = -risk)
save(MPLS.LS, file = "./data/MPLS.LS.Rdata")
load(file = "./data/MPLS.LS.Rdata")

write.csv(MPLS.LS, file="./data/MPLS.LS.csv")


# Sometimes we will have data in long format and want it back in wide format
# We can also go from long to wide format using the reshape function
MPLS.W <- reshape(data = MPLS.LS, v.names = "read", idvar = "subid",
                  drop = c("riskC", "ell2"), timevar = "grade", direction = "wide")
MPLS.W
save(MPLS.W, file = "./data/MPLS.W.Rdata")
load(file = "./data/MPLS.W.Rdata")

##---------------------------------------------------
# Descriptive Statistics in Long Format
# Before we calculated means by risk now lets do it longitudinally by grade:
tail(MPLS.LS)
by_grade<-summarize(group_by(MPLS.LS,grade),
                    mean = mean(read, na.rm=TRUE))

by_grade<-as.data.frame(by_grade)
by_grade

# And now we can efficiently get additional information:
by_grade<-summarize(group_by(MPLS.LS,grade),
                    mRead = mean(read, na.rm=TRUE),
                    sdRead = sd(read, na.rm=TRUE),
                    countRead = n(),
                    complete = sum(!is.na(read)))

by_grade<-as.data.frame(by_grade)
by_grade
# Neat!
# Also note that if we wanted to change the column names in 'by_grade'
# we could use the colnames() function.
?colnames()

# For instance, assume that we wanted the correlation between the different grade levels
# Fist we need to reformat our data
mylist <- split(MPLS.LS$read, MPLS.LS$grade)
mylist
# The split function (from the base package) splits the reading scores according to 
# our time variable, in this case "grade".
str(mylist)
# We can then use do.call() to bind this list back together into a dataframe
myread <- do.call(cbind, mylist)
myread
# and then we can use the colnames() function to rename columns in myread
colnames(myread) <- paste("grade", as.character(5:8), sep = ".")
myread
# Correlation and covariance matrices are now super easy to calculate!
cov(myread, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor(myread, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

##---------------------------------------------------
# Missing Data
# It is often important for us to understand how much data is missing 
# and how/why it is missing. For instance, data could be:
## 1. Missing Completely at Random
## 2. Missing at Random
## 3. Not missing at Random

# As above, Long's code no long seems to work in current R/plyr...
ddply(.data = data.frame(is.na(MPLS.LS$read)), .variables = .(grade = MPLS.LS$grade),
      each(prop.miss = mean))

# But I have rewritten working code here:
head(MPLS.LS)
ddply(MPLS.LS,~grade,summarise,
      missing=sum(is.na(read)))

# Similarly, we might want to condition our calculation on multiple predictors.
# Again, I can't get Long's original code to work...
mgrge <- ddply(data.frame(MPLS.LS$read), .(grade = MPLS.LS$grade, gender = MPLS.LS$gen),
               each(mean.read = mean), na.rm = TRUE)
mgrge

# ... but here is a functional rewrite:
head(MPLS.LS)
ddply(MPLS.LS,~grade+gen,summarise,
      meanRead=mean(read, na.rm=TRUE))

# We can also condition our calculations on variables we create.
# For instance, we can use the cut_number() function from ggplot2
# to create a "median split" of the attendance variable:
MPLS.LS$att.split<-cut_number(MPLS.LS$att, n=2)
head(MPLS.LS)
mgrat <- ddply(MPLS.LS,~grade+att.split,summarise,
               meanRead=mean(read, na.rm=TRUE))
mgrat

# If we don't like R's automatic levels from the cut_number() function,
# We can assign our own labels to that factors
mgrat$att.split <- factor(mgrat$att.split, labels = c("Low", "High"))
mgrat

# In longitudinal data, especially clinical or "non-experimental" data,
# you are likekly to have a lot of missing data ('NAs').
# It is important for us to understand where these NAs are missing, and
# how different functions in R handle NAs.

# One of the strengthes of the LMER approach, compared to RM ANOVA,
# is that LMER can glide seemlessly over missing values, fitting lines
# based on the data available for each subject. 
# However, this is only true for the outcome variable (i.e., reading scores
# over time). If a subject is missing a value for a 'Sex' variable and sex
# is one of the variables we are trying to model, that subject will be 
# dropped from our analysis. 

# In some cases, we can control when/where we encounter NAs. As we have 
# seen, we can use the 'na.rm =' argument in a function. We can also use
# the na.omit() function to strip ROWS THAT HAVE NAS out of a data frame:
MPLS.LS3 <- subset(MPLS.LS, subid < 4, select = c(subid, read, grade, gen))
MPLS.LS3
# Note that subject 2 is missing a reading score in grade 8

omit1 <- na.omit(MPLS.LS3)
omit1
# Using na.omit() removes all grade information for subject 2

# Now let's suppose that we are missing gender information for subject 1
MPLS.LS3a <- MPLS.LS3
MPLS.LS3a[1:4,4] <- NA
MPLS.LS3a

# Using the na.omit() function here mimics how LMER will treat a subject
# who is missing a static variable:
omit2 <- na.omit(MPLS.LS3a)
omit2
# As you can see, subject 1's data is dropped completely.

# It is important to understand how LMER (and R more generally) handle
# missing cases. 
# The reason understanding missing cases is so important is that the 
# statistical modelling procedures we will use ASSUME that all models 
# are based on the same amount of data. 
# Therefore, if data are used in one model, but missing in another model, 
# this means those two models cannot be compared.
#
# Consider:
# Model 1: Reading ~ Grade 
# Model 2: Reading ~ Grade + Sex
# If even one subject is missing a value for 'Sex', that means that 
# Model 2 is based on less data and, therefore, any model comparison is
# not going to be valid.
